# OKR Genius Documentation

## 1. Introduction

"OKR Genius" is an advanced web application designed to help teams and organizations simplify and enhance the process of defining, tracking, and achieving their Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Using Artificial Intelligence algorithms, the platform offers data-driven OKR suggestions aligned with the organization's business objectives and strategies. Users can customize, track in real-time, and collaborate on OKRs, all within an integrated and secure system. Its operation is based on the following points:

- **Objective Definition**: Begin by setting your organization's overall objectives and goals, specifying what you want to achieve and in what timeframe.
- **AI-Driven Suggestions**: OKR Genius uses advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze business data, historical performance, and industry benchmarks. It then generates suggested OKRs that are realistic, measurable, and align with your goals.
- **Customization**: Customize the generated OKRs to match your organization's unique priorities and strategies. This includes modifying key results, setting target values, and adding context as needed.
- **Alignment**: Ensure all OKRs, both individual and team-based, align with the organization's higher-level goals. OKR Genius assists in breaking down goals across the company.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your OKRs' progress in real time. OKR Genius provides visual dashboards and analytics, allowing you to oversee key outcomes, spot trends, and identify areas needing attention.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Gain insights into your OKRs' performance and discover patterns that can influence strategic decisions. OKR Genius offers data-driven progress recommendations.
- **Collaboration**: Collaborate with teams and individual members to ensure everyone is working towards common goals. Share OKRs, updates, and feedback within the platform.
- **Integration**: OKR Genius integrates with other business tools and platforms to optimize your workflow and improve data accuracy.
- **Security and Privacy**: Your OKR data is protected and complies with privacy regulations. OKR Genius prioritizes data security and confidentiality.

In summary, OKR Genius uses AI to simplify and enhance OKR management, helping organizations better align their objectives and boost performance. Creating an account is straightforward, and you can securely access your OKRs and performance data on your user profile.

## 2. System Architecture
We decided to use Next.js for its distinctive features:

Automatic Optimization: This feature enhances both the performance and the user experience when interacting with the application.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): This functionality is essential for gaining benefits in SEO and ensuring fast web loading times.
Integrated API Functions: This integration facilitates communication between the frontend and the backend without requiring additional configurations.
Rapid Development: Thanks to tools like hot reloading, the development process becomes more efficient and agile.
### 2.1. Frontend

The "OKR Genius" application uses Next.js as its frontend framework. The structure is based on pages representing different views in the app, such as "Home", "create-okr", and "objetive-okr". Next.js API functions are used to communicate with the backend.


2.2. Backend
For our backend and data management, we have chosen PostgreSQL and Prisma for the following reasons:

Relational Schemas (PostgreSQL): By using a relational database, we can manage complex data relationships more efficiently and in a structured manner.
Data Integrity (PostgreSQL): PostgreSQL ensures data integrity through the use of primary keys, uniqueness constraints, and transactions, which are essential for maintaining data consistency.
Agile Development (Prisma): Prisma offers an abstraction layer over SQL databases, which simplifies database operations with a more straightforward syntax and a strong typing system. This accelerates development and keeps the code clean and maintainable.
With these technological choices, we aim to guarantee a robust, scalable, and efficient application that meets all the demands and needs of our users.

2.3. Database
We use PostgreSQL as our database, managed through Prisma as ORM. Our database is structured into models that represent different entities in the system:

User: Stores user information such as email, username, encrypted password, password reset tokens, and references to associated OKRs.
PasswordResetToken: Contains password reset tokens, each associated with a specific user, with timestamps for their creation and use.
Okr: Contains all OKRs generated by users, associated by user ID. OKRs are structured to include content, results, and timestamps.
This structure allows us to efficiently manage the relationships between different types of data, ensuring coherent and secure data handling.

## 3. Main Features

### 3.1. Authentication

Authentication is managed through Next Auth. When a user registers, their details are stored in the `users` collection. Login checks credentials and generates a JWT token for the session.

### 3.2. OKR Generation

OKRs are generated based on objectives entered by the user and information analyzed by AI algorithms. Once generated, they're stored in the `okrs` collection.

### 3.3. Download OKRs in PDF

We use the "pdf-lib" library to generate PDFs. Users can select OKRs and generate a PDF report for direct download.

### 3.4. OKR History

Past OKRs for each user are stored and can be viewed in a "History" section. Each OKR has an associated date, allowing users to review their progress over time.

## 4. Integrations

"OKR Genius" integrates with the OpenAI API, one of the most advanced programming interfaces in the AI field. This integration is crucial for providing users with AI-based OKR suggestions. By utilizing the OpenAI API, "OKR Genius" can:

- Analyze previously defined goals by organizations and offer optimized OKRs based on historical and current data.
- Recognize patterns and trends from vast datasets, enabling the generation of more relevant OKRs aligned with organizations' current needs.
- Provide ongoing recommendations to adjust and refine OKRs as circumstances or business goals change.

This integration ensures "OKR Genius" remains at the forefront of AI-based OKR management solutions, offering users more accurate and valuable recommendations.

5. Deployment
We will deploy "OKR Genius" on Vercel, a leading platform for modern web application deployment. The deployment process is as follows:

Connect with Vercel: Begin by linking your "OKR Genius" repository to Vercel. This is achieved through Vercel's intuitive interface, where you select your repository and grant Vercel the necessary access.
Environment Variables Configuration: Prior to deployment, it is crucial to set up environment variables in Vercel. This includes, but is not limited to, PostgreSQL credentials and OpenAI API access keys. These variables are essential for the correct operation of the app in the production environment. Since Vercel Postgres is a serverless, fully-managed relational database designed to work seamlessly with modern frontend frameworks, ensure that your DATABASE_URL variable reflects your Vercel Postgres connection details.
Initiate Deployment: With all configurations in place, initiate the deployment process on Vercel. The platform automates the build and optimization of your app, ensuring optimal performance.
Deployment Monitoring: Vercel provides tools to monitor your deployment status, offering real-time logs and insights to quickly identify and resolve any potential issues.
Launch: Upon successful completion of the deployment, "OKR Genius" will be accessible online. Users will enjoy a fast and secure experience, powered by Vercel's global infrastructure, with the robust backend support of serverless PostgreSQL.
By adhering to these steps, we ensure that "OKR Genius" is deployed efficiently, securely, and with high performance, leveraging the advantages of Vercel Postgres for our database needs.

## Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the "OKR Genius" project in your local environment.

2. Use the `.env.example` file as a template. This file should list all necessary environment variables for your project.
3. Fill in the `.env` file with your own values. Ensure to include the PostgreSQL database connection string and any other relevant configurations.

Example `.env` content:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/YOUR_DATABASE"
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret

... other variables ...
```

### Run Migrations with Prisma
